# Graph Ambient Weather

This is a pair of simple programs intended to graph one or
two data sets from the backup file created by the Ambient 
WS-2000 oersonal weather station.  I suspect that the backup
file for the WS-2902 is very similar, if not identical, so 
probably only small tweaks would be needed to work with that 
station.

## Heavily commented!

I'm hoping that this program will be helpful to some of my
grandchildren to start with Python, so it is heavily 
commented, not just with details about the program, but also
about general Python things.

## Reason for the program

Why create this program, when both WunderGround.com and 
AmbientWeather.net will provide graphs of these data?
Because their graphs will only cover a month at a time, at
most, and I wanted to be able to graph arbitrary time ranges
from one day, to the entire data set from the earliest data 
available to the latest. Plus, it was fun.

## Feedback

If you find any problems with this program, please let me
know at <al@simonshome.org>. I'm not running a bug tracker 
for this repo at this time. If you are successful using this
with a WS-2902 or other Ambient station, or have a backup
file you could send to me, please let me know. Finally, if
you would like to modify the program and have your changes 
merged back in, please create a pull request.
